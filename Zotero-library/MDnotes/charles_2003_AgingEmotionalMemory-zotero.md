### Abstract

 Two studies examined age differences in recall and recognition memory for positive, negative, and neutral stimuli. In Study 1, younger, middle-aged, and older adults were shown images on a computer screen and, after a distraction task, were asked first to recall as many as they could and then to identify previously shown images from a set of old and new ones. The relative number of negative images compared with positive and neutral images recalled decreased with each successively older age group. Recognition memory showed a similar decrease with age in the relative memory advantage for negative pictures. In Study 2, the largest age differences in recall and recognition accuracy were also for the negative images. Findings are consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory, which posits greater investment in emotion regulation with age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

> "Prior research strongly supports the association between older age and increased emphasis on emotion, but none of these studies have distinguished between positive and negative material. Thus, it remains unclear whether the age effect is driven primarily by differences in memory such that positive material is remembered better than negative material, which would support the contention that memory is associated with self-regulation, or if the effect is equivalent for positive and negative emotion, which would suggest a more general increase in emotion salience associated with age that is not necessarily related to regulatory benefits."
